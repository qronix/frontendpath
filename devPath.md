## Software Engineering Path

<br>


### Common Questions and Answers

<br>

#### What is a software engineer?

A software engineer is an individual who carefully plans and constructs complicated software systems. 
<br>A competent engineer will use best practices and focus on implementing a clean an extensible solution</br>
which is maintainable and easy to work with

#### Why become a software engineer?

Being a software engineer can be very challenging. You will face new problems every day without fail.
Engineers are constantly learning new things, <br>not just because they like to, but because it is absolutely vital
to know about the new technologies and changes within the industry. You can <br>
work from anywhere remotely! You gain the ability to build basically anything you can imagine, and it is very fun<br>
and rewarding to solve complicated problems with elegant (hopefully) solutions.

Being a software engineer is essentially like being an architect, you plan out the work, and then you get started <br>
implementing the plan.

#### How is a software engineer different from a programmer?

A programmer is someone who knows how to write code; however, their implementations are usually clunky and hacky <br>
and they typically begin coding without any planning or design.

An engineer however, deeply focuses on the plan and design and will not begin writing code until they are <br>
certain about its implementation.

#### What is the job market like for a software engineer?

Excellent! Due to plenty of online courses, YouTube, and coding bootcamp, the job market is saturated <br>
with programmers; this is fantastic news for engineers. Why? Because engineers are what companies want. <br>
Most people can take an online course and write some code, but an engineer takes writing code to an entirely <br>
new level and brings competence and critical thinking to the table. Companies want engineers that can <br>
adapt quickly to industry changes, implement professional and reliable solutions, and are hungry for growth.

Companies are having difficulty finding quality engineers because the "programmers", who think they are engineers <br>
don't have a clue what they are doing and businesses are not going to let them loose on their critical infrastructure <br>
where a mistake by a programmer can ruin a relationship with one or more customers.

#### Don't I need a degree to become an engineer?

Absolutely not. It's actually advisable that people do not pursue a degree in computer science. How come?<br>
Colleges typically do not teach what is currently used within the tech industry. Most importantly, by the time <br>
a computer science student has graduated, almost every way of doing things has changed and their education is mostly<br>
invalid. It is an extremely common occurrence that comp sci majors get their first job and don't have a damn <br>
clue as to what is going on.

#### Do I need to be good at math?

Nope. It would be a good idea to learn some math, as it helps you think about algorithms and certainly helps with <br>
problem-solving. However, you will typically only encounter math while working with machine learning / A.I. and <br>
graphics / simulation programming.

#### Do I have to be a genius to program?

Hahaha, no.

#### This seems super complicated, I don't think I can learn this.

You 100% can learn this, and it certainly does seem complicated, because it is! However, it is a superb <br>
challenge which engages your mind and basically forces you to improve and grow or get left behind.

#### Why are there so many programming languages, why don't people just use one language?

Mainly because lots of people wanted certain features out of their favorite language and ended up <br>
making their own language to have the features they wanted.

#### Is HTML a programming language?

No. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is simply a<br> syntax used to describe the layout of a web page.
This syntax is interpreted by web <br>browsers and used to display a structured web page.

#### What is a front-end developer?

A front-end developer owns everything the user sees in their browser. <br>This includes CSS, HTML, and Javascript. As well
as, localization, accessibility, and animations / user interactions and experience.<br>
Front-end devs implement designs constructed by UI/UX designers and features based on user stories.<br>
Most people will typically start as a front-end developer as the criticality of their work does not (or should not)
cause massive problems for clients if things go wrong.

#### What is a back-end developer?

A back-end developer creates and maintains server environments, builds and implements the designs for <br>
APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), and works closely with databases and customer data. Due to the close <br>
relationship a back-end developer has with data, they are typically more senior engineers, and usually are never <br>
new hires.

#### What is a fullstack developer?

A fullstack developer is an engineer who is capable and comfortable of working on the back and front ends of an application.
These developers (ideally) have multiple years of experience as a front-end and back-end engineer and can competently 
implement a full solution from start to finish.

#### What is the cloud?

The cloud is a term used to identify large data centers which are accessible globally across the internet.

#### Do I need any certifications to get a job?

No. You do not need certifications to land your first job; however, it is highly recommended that you pursue relevant
certifications after you enter the industry.

#### What can I expect while traveling this path?

Well, that depends on which path you want to take. Do you want to be a typical programmer that knows a language or two,<br>
but does not have deep knowledge of the technologies they use or even why they are doing the things they do?

Or, do you want to be a competent engineer who has deep knowledge of software architecture with an established <br>
and strong foundational base resulting in the ability to use multiple languages with ease while also understanding <br>
the what, why, and how?

If you want to be a programmer then work on some Udemy courses, build an app or two and then apply for jobs.

If you want to be a competent engineer, then the road is going to be a lot more difficult, rewarding, and fun!


### The path to becoming a software engineer

The path presented here has two phases, the first phase is aimed at getting you up to speed on the basics while establishing
strong fundamentals as quickly as possible. The second phase is a slower, long-term phase which emphasises software
architecture principles, computer science principles, exposure to more programming languages, networking, CI/CD,
best practices, design patterns, and lower level programming languages.

### Why is the path setup this way? Shouldn't I learn all the other things first?

No. It is incredibly important to get into the field and surround yourself with experienced engineers as soon as possible.<br>
Doing so will force your growth and put you far ahead of others who start with the long road.<br>
Theory and architecture principles are certainly needed and a requirement to proceed past an entry-level role; <br>
however, hands-on experience and direct critique and feedback from experienced engineers will be far more <br>
beneficial when starting out.

For instance, you may take the long way and learn a lot of things and theories, but develop terrible coding practices<br>
which can be hard to break. When you establish a working set of fundamentals and then leap into the deep-end<br>
your bad practices will be exposed instantly and the senior engineers around you can help you get better faster, and
prevent bad habits from taking root to begin with.

### Alright, alright, what is the path?

**Let's dig in!**


## Phase One

This path assumes you have little to no programming experience and thus will take you from knowing nothing, to being
a competent developer, capable of landing <br> their first job in the industry.

In phase one the goal is to establish a base of knowledge to become a front-end developer. We are focusing on <br>
front-end for a few reasons:

- Front-end is easier to learn when starting out
- You get to see the immediate results of your efforts in the browser!
- Companies are not going to hire a green back-end engineer
- You learn how browsers work
- Use of JavaScript which is relatively easy to learn
- Front-end exposes you to more topics early on such as design, UI/UX, styling, color theory, typography
- Experience on the front-end will help you become a stronger back-end developer as you are thinking about
  user experience, speed / optimization, and how to build an easy-to-use API

### Foreword

This material can be quite challenging to newcomers. You may feel overwhelmed, frustrated, or irritated at times.
If these negative emotions arise, take a step back, go for a walk, meditate, and then continue. These ideas are completely
new to you and can be difficult to digest at times. This is perfectly normal and is not an indication that you cannot comprehend
the materials, just that you need to take a break.

You may feel like "this is not for me." or "I'm no good at this." or "I'm not smart enough for this.", these are all perfectly
normal thoughts, and they actually plague the software industry, so much so that there is a term for it **imposter syndrome**.

All developers have experienced imposter syndrome at some point in their careers and most developers experience it frequently
throughout their first and sometimes even second years in the industry. It's okay to have these thoughts, just know that they 
are not true, if you want to be an engineer, **YOU CAN**.

### How to learn successfully

You are going to be covering a **vast** amount of information and in a short period of time. There are a few things
that you must do to ensure your success:

- Don't get frustrated, this stuff can be challenging
- Don't doubt yourself, all the things you are learning were made by humans just like yourself
- If you come across something that you do not understand **STOP IMMEDIATELY** and do whatever you need to in order to understand
    the topic. If you make a habit of kicking the can down the road, I promise that you will see whatever you have swept under
    the rug again in the future, and it will be at the most inopportune time (say, in an interview). **DO NOT SHY AWAY FROM A DIFFICULT TOPIC**, instead, dive in and learn!
- Make use of the [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) to increase your study effectiveness. Checkout the simple Pomodoro tool [Pomofocus](https://pomofocus.io/)
- Take notes! Do not just passively watch videos, take notes. If a tutorial or article covers something interesting, difficult, or seemingly important, make a note in a text editor.
- Once you are done with a class or tutorial, take your notes and convert them into flashcards using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). Anki is a [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) application which allows you to create note cards and then study them right as your brain is about to forget the learned information; this repetition reinforces your retention and is excellent for learning software topics
- When making note cards, make them challenging for yourself! Don't use simple yes/no questions, force yourself to answer in detail.
- When you learn something new which you can use, for instance, a feature of JavaScript, go use it immediately!! Mess around with it, break it, learn about it.
- If your instructor is coding on screen **code along**! Do not just sit there and watch the course.

### Basic Foundations


#### Network Fundamentals

It is important to understand how the internet works and how computers network; this is useful as it helps you understand
a little more of what is going on under the hood in your browser and how data gets from the client to the server and 
vice-versa.

[Free Code Camp - How does the internet work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN8YNNHcaZc)

#### HTTP Response Codes

HTTP response codes are numbers between `100-599` which indicate a certain status of a web request<br>
It is important to know what these codes mean, so you can troubleshoot issues.

A good general rule that you may hear in the industry is:<br>
`100-199`: Hold on<br>
`200-299`: Everything is good<br>
`300-399`: Not here, over there<br>
`400-499`: You fucked up<br>
`500-599`: I fucked up<br>


[MDN - HTTP Response Codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)


#### Basics of computing and computer science

Checkout the [Computer Science Crash Course from PBS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PLH2l6uzC4UEW0s7-KewFLBC1D0l6XRfye)

You don't need to watch all the videos now, I would focus on #s: `11-17, 20, 27, 29, 30 and 31`

projects using the proper tooling, testing, and technologies mentioned above, you can now consider yourself a front-end
engineer!

**However, we aren't quite done yet....**

## Preparing for the interview

Your interview will most likely involve several technical questions and one or two whiteboard questions, you may even be asked to solve a programming challenge via coding, on the spot!

### Topics with which you should be comfortable going into your interview

- Flow control
- Automated testing
- Unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing
- What an API is and how to use one
- Authentication vs Authorization
- Basic security topics, check out [Owasp top 10 security risks for 2021](https://sucuri.net/guides/owasp-top-10-security-vulnerabilities-2021/)
- [Test Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
- [The Kanban Method](https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-kanban)
- [JavaScript Design Patterns](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/)

### Resources to help you prepare for the interview

Flow control, automated testing, APIs, and auth vs auth were already covered in the path materials above. Refer back to those resources if you need a refresher.

Reading about Owasp top 10, TDD (Test Driven Development), and Kanban will be sufficient for your interview.

To learn about Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming, read the materials above and build out some simple examples to get a good idea of why you would use them and in what situations.

For data structures and algorithms, I highly recommend [Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures and Algorithms - Andrei Neagoie](https://www.udemy.com/course/master-the-coding-interview-data-structures-algorithms/)

You should also be familiar with:

1. [Web Dev Best Practices - 2021](https://dev.to/ashok83/9-web-development-best-practices-for-2021-31o1)
2. [JavaScript Best Practices - Patterns and Anti-Patterns](https://shichuan.github.io/javascript-patterns/)
3. [JavaScript Optimization Tips](https://dev.to/blessingartcreator/17-javascript-optimization-tips-3gil)
4. [React Best Practices - 2021](https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/react-best-practices/)
5. [React Patterns and Anti-Patterns](https://dev.to/justboris/popular-patterns-and-anti-patterns-with-react-hooks-4da2) and [also](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/react-best-practices-avoiding-bad-practices-fefe6062787d)

### Your Portfolio
You should build a few small projects and one or two large projects using everything you have learned and add them to your 
portfolio. Your portfolio can be on GitHub (simply your GitHub profile) or a personal website. Make sure these projects demonstrate a wide range of your skillset and that these projects **are challenging** to you.

### Practicing Programming

Studying notepads using Anki is an excellent way to retain theory and syntax, however, this is not as useful as actually
programming. You will learn FAR more by working on projects. You should always pick a project that you feel is just outside your current skill range, this will force you to grow.

You should also check out and practice [The top 100 JavaScript Interview Questions for 2021](https://www.guru99.com/javascript-interview-questions-answers.html) and [A massive collection of advanced JavaScript questions](https://github.com/lydiahallie/javascript-questions).

If you have trouble coming up with project ideas, I highly recommend [Wes Bos' 30 Days of JavaScript](https://javascript30.com/) this is a completely free, self-paced collection of JavaScript projects and the best part is, master web developer Wes Bos walks you through each project and explains things in detail.

Lastly, you need to practice every day! Check out [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) for practice problems. To practice advanced topics and really push the boundary, sign up for [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
